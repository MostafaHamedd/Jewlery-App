# Jewelry App

Welcome to the repository for my jewelry app! This repository showcases a collection of screenshots that provide a glimpse into the user interface and functionality of the application. Please note that the original repository is set to private due to the sensitive nature of accessing the database directly.

The decision to keep the repository private was made to ensure the security and integrity of the store's database.
